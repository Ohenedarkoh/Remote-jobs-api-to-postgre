Think Twitter, WhatsApp, and TikTok fused into one global superapp — built natively using Rust, Blockchain, and AI/ML.Our vision is bold. We’re not just creating another app — we’re creating the platform. A decentralized, multilingual football community powered by real-time translation for Twitter-style microblogging and TikTok-style videos in over 200 languages.But this isn't just social.
